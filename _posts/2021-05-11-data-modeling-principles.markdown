The current discourse on data can get a little tiring because of its [over focus on tooling](https://twitter.com/rahulj51/status/1254447785170042882). It feels like a new SaaS gets launched every week in the data space.

Here's a short infographic I recently wrote to distill some fundamental principles for organizing and transforming data in a warehouse. These are principles that my team and I learned the hard way in the course of building our data warehouse at Omio over last three years.

You will notice that this chart does not indulge in the debate about data lake vs warehouse or marts, suggests technologies or obsesses over Kimball vs Inmon vs Linstedt. Instead, it offers suggestions that are orthogonal to these choices and more fundamental in nature. 

As you will notice, this is a highly opinionated set of guidelines. The reader is advised to not treat these dogmatically, nor get triggered by some seemingly extreme views. Most of these principles are very contextual. YMMV. :-)
