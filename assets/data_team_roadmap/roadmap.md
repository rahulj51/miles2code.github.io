#  **Data Engineering Roadmap**


## **Data Products**

Create core pipelines as end-trend products instead of a mishmash of storages, pipelines, ML, visualizations, KPIs etc.   

Branch out to Product Features, System capabilities and User Experience.

### Data Product 1

- System Capabilities

- User Experience

- Features

### Data Product 2

### Others...

### Bespoke Data Pipelines

These are pipelines that are not supported as product yet because of very limited use-cases. 

- Maintain Existing

- Introduce New

## Raw Data Tracking

All data products eventually depend on raw data. Branch out based on core classifiers (e. Front-End vs Back-End but could be anything else too).
