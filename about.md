Hi, You have reached my personal blog site. 

I am Rahul.

I write code, sometimes blog and often [tweet](https://twitter.com/rahulj51) about data, software engineering and engineering leadership.

I also offer 1<>1 mentoring through [The Mentoring Club](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/rahul-jain). 

Sometimes, I provide consulting to startups in Europe and India on their data engineering setup.
