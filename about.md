In my day job, I work as [Head of Business Intelligence and Analytics Engineering at Beat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-jain-83055b45/).

I frequently code, sometimes blog and often [tweet](https://twitter.com/rahulj51) about data, software engineering and engineering leadership.

I offer professional consultation and advice on data and analytics engineering related topics at [Office Hours](https://officehours.com/rahul-jain).

I volunteer my time as a career coach and mentor at [The Mentoring Club](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/rahul-jain).
