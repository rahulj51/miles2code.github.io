Hi, You have reached my personal blog site. 

I am Rahul.

I live in [Berlin, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) with my wife Jay.

I frequently code, sometimes blog and often [tweet](https://twitter.com/rahulj51) about data, software engineering and engineering leadership.

I offer free 1<>1 career coaching through [The Mentoring Club](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/rahul-jain). 

I occasionally provide consultation to startups in Europe and India on data engineering.

In my day job, I work as [Head of Business Intelligence and Analytics Engineering at Beat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-jain-83055b45/).
